You are an expert full-stack architect. Transform this project idea into a coherent, actionable technical specification.

**Input**:
- Project Idea: "a simple quiz app using next js and tailwind css"
- Development Approach: "MVP coding"

**ðŸ”’ CRITICAL OUTPUT MODE**:
Generate ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS and DECISION FRAMEWORKS, not literal implementation details.

For all conventions (naming, structure, flow), provide:
- The PATTERN with reasoning
- EXAMPLE FORMAT to illustrate the pattern
- IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE for applying the pattern

Do NOT specify literal names unless the user explicitly provides them. The goal is TRANSFERABLE ARCHITECTURE that adapts to any domain.

**ðŸ”’ ABSOLUTE GROUNDING LAW**:
Once you define ANY PATTERN in Phase 1 (database schema patterns, API structure patterns, naming conventions, data flow patterns, file organization patterns, error handling patterns), that pattern becomes IMMUTABLE LAW for ALL subsequent phases.

EVERY new feature MUST:
- Follow the EXACT PATTERNS from Phase 1 (not literal examples, but the pattern rules)
- Apply patterns contextually to the specific domain
- Reference pattern rules explicitly: "Uses Phase 1 [pattern name]"

**Output Structure**:

**1. Project Understanding** (3-4 sentences)
- What problem are we solving and for whom?
- What is the core user value?
- What defines success for this MVP?

**2. Architecture Decisions**
- Frontend: [Choose technology] - justify based on project needs
- Backend: [Choose technology] - justify based on project needs
- Database: [Choose technology] - justify based on data patterns
- **Naming Philosophy**: [Describe approach - e.g., "verbose self-documenting" vs "terse industry-standard" based on user input]
- **Critical**: Explain how these form a coherent system

**3. ðŸ”’ FOUNDATIONAL PATTERN ANCHORS (Phase 1 - IMMUTABLE LAW)**

**A. DATABASE SCHEMA PATTERN ANCHORS**:

**Table Naming Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define the pattern structure with placeholders]
- Reasoning: [Why this pattern?]
- Example Format: [Show 2-3 examples illustrating the pattern]
- Implementation Guidance: When creating tables, ask: [decision framework]

**Column Naming Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define convention]
- Reasoning: [Why this approach?]
- Example Format: [Show examples]

**Primary Key Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define PK approach]
- Example Format: [Show structure]

**Foreign Key Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define FK naming]
- Example Format: [Show how to derive FK names]

**Timestamp Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define timestamp approach]
- Example Format: [Show structure]

**Relationship Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define how relationships work]
- Example Format: [Show 1:M and M:M examples]

ALL future tables MUST follow these PATTERN RULES. Apply rules to your specific domain - don't copy examples literally.

**B. API PATTERN ANCHORS**:

**Endpoint Structure Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define URL structure with placeholders]
- Reasoning: [Why this structure?]
- Example Format: [Show pattern applied to sample resources]

**HTTP Method Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define which verbs for which operations]
- Example Format: [Show the mapping]

**Request/Response Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define data format structure]
- Example Format: [Show success and error response patterns]

ALL future endpoints MUST follow these PATTERN RULES applied to your domain.

**C. AUTHENTICATION PATTERN ANCHOR**:

**Auth Flow Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define auth mechanism]
- Reasoning: [Why this approach for this project type?]
- Implementation Guidance: [How to apply to protected routes]

ALL protected features MUST follow this EXACT auth pattern.

**D. DATA ACCESS PATTERN ANCHOR**:

**Layer Structure Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define layer separation with responsibilities]
- Reasoning: [Why these layers?]
- File Naming Pattern: [Define naming rule with placeholders]
- Example Format: [Show pattern applied to sample feature]

ALL features MUST follow this EXACT layer pattern.

**E. ERROR HANDLING PATTERN ANCHOR**:

**Error Response Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define error structure]
- Error Code Pattern: [Define code naming convention]
- Example Format: [Show pattern in use]

ALL endpoints MUST follow this EXACT error pattern.

**F. FRONTEND PATTERN ANCHORS**:

**State Management Pattern**:
- Global State Rule: [When/how to use]
- Server State Rule: [When/how to use]
- Local State Rule: [When/how to use]

**Component Pattern**:
- Pattern Rule: [Define component organization]
- File Naming Pattern: [Define naming rule]
- Example Format: [Show pattern applied]

ALL components MUST follow these EXACT patterns.

**4. MVP Feature Set** (3-5 core features)

For EACH feature write:

**Feature: [Name based on domain]**

**Pattern Application** (show how Phase 1 patterns apply):
- ðŸ”’ Database: Applies [Pattern A rules] â†’ In this domain: [show contextual application]
- ðŸ”’ API: Applies [Pattern B rules] â†’ Endpoint: [derive from pattern]
- ðŸ”’ Auth: Applies [Pattern C rules] â†’ [how it's used here]
- ðŸ”’ Data Flow: Applies [Pattern D rules] â†’ [show layers for this feature]
- ðŸ”’ Errors: Applies [Pattern E rules] â†’ [show error handling]
- ðŸ”’ Frontend: Applies [Pattern F rules] â†’ [show state/component usage]

**Complete Data Flow**:
[Show user action through system using the patterns, with domain-specific examples]

**Dependencies**: [What must exist first?]

**5. Implementation Phases**

**Phase 1 - Pattern Foundation**:
- Define ALL pattern anchors (A-F) with reasoning
- Create initial schema applying patterns to domain
- Implement first feature as pattern reference
- **Output**: "Phase 1 establishes these PATTERN RULES: [list patterns, not examples]"

**Phase 2 - Core Features**:
- Feature 1: **PATTERN CHECK** - Uses [Pattern A, B, C...] applied to [domain context]
- Feature 2: **PATTERN CHECK** - Uses [same patterns] applied differently for [context]
- **VALIDATION**: Confirm patterns are reused, not redefined

**Phase 3 - Enhancement**:
- Feature 1: **PATTERN CHECK** - Extends Phase 1-2 patterns to [new context]
- **VALIDATION**: Confirm zero new patterns, only new applications of existing patterns

**6. MVP Scope**
- **IN**: [Essential features] - why essential?
- **OUT**: [Deferred features] - why defer?

**7. ðŸ”’ PATTERN CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST**

Verify pattern reuse (not literal copying):
- [ ] All tables follow Phase 1 naming PATTERN RULE
- [ ] All APIs follow Phase 1 endpoint PATTERN RULE
- [ ] All auth uses Phase 1 flow PATTERN
- [ ] All data access follows Phase 1 layer PATTERN
- [ ] All errors follow Phase 1 response PATTERN
- [ ] All components follow Phase 1 organization PATTERN
- [ ] Phase 2-3 features APPLY patterns to their specific context
- [ ] ZERO new patterns introduced - only new applications

**Meta-Architecture Principle**:
You're defining the "rules of the game," not the specific moves. Patterns should be transferable across similar projects. Implementation details emerge from applying patterns to the specific domain in user input.
